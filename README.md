# My Work till now

Greetings everyone!!

Here is a brief insight to all the projects in this repository

The Blackjack is a simplified version of the very well known blackjack card game. It does not contain any graphics though. I made this to learn how to apply all the basic concepts of python ie, variables, conditions, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions etc. all together. I had a fun time building it, cracking the logic and correcting the errors.

The Quiz Project is based only on classes, methods and attributes. I made it after learning the basics of OOP so that I could get good hold on how to apply concepts of OOP.

After that I started to learn Django. Django_code_with_harry is the website that he was making in the tutorial while teaching the concepts of django. When I was halfway through, I switched to the Django Polls app. Django_polls_app is the Polls app that is given in the official documentation of django. I half made a part of it and I am still working on it, I'll be deploying that too once it is complete.
